## Detail of plugins

### Hello World

A sample Hello World plugin for demonstration and learning purposes.

This plugin provides a few unauthenticated requests, all beginning with "ping", to demonstrate basic binder capabilities.

**Verbs**:

* _ping:_ returns a success response
* _pingfail:_ returns a failure response
* _pingnull:_ returns a success response, with an empty JSON response field
* _pingbug:_ does a memory violation (intercepted by the binder)
* _pingJson:_ returns a success response, with a complex JSON response field
* _pingevent:_ broadcasts a global event

<br />


### Authentication

An sample Authentication plugin for demonstration purposes.

This plugin provides a few requests to demonstrate the binder's token-based security mechanism.

Calling "_connect_" with a security token will initiate a session, calling "_refresh_" will issue a new token and invalidate the previous one, calling "_logout_" will invalidate all tokens and close the session.

**Verbs**:

* _ping:_ returns a success response
* _connect:_ creates a session and returns a new token
* _refresh:_ returns a new token
* _check:_ verifies the passed token is valid
* _logout:_ closes the session

<br />


### Tic Tac Toe

A sample Tic Tac Toe game plugin.

This plugin provides an interactive Tic Tac Toe game where the binder returns the grid as a JSON response. 

**Verbs**:

* _new:_ starts a new game
* _play:_ asks the server to play
* _move:_ gives a client move
* _board:_ gets the current board state, as a JSON structure
* _level_: sets the server level
* _join_: joins an existing board
* _undo_: undo the last move
* _wait_: wait for a move

<br />


### Audio

A sample Audio plugin with 2 backends:

* ALSA (mandatory)
* PulseAudio (optional)

This plugin is able to initialize a specific soundcard, define volume levels, channels (mono/stereo...), mute sound, and play a 22,050 Hz PCM stream.

**Verbs**:

* _ping:_ returns a success response
* _init:_ initializes backend, on the "default" sound card
* _volume:_ gets or sets volume, in % (0-100)
* _channels:_ gets or sets channels count (1-8)
* _mute:_ gets or sets the mute status (on-off)
* _play_: gets or sets the playing status (on-off)

_(if PulseAudio development libraries are not found at build time, only ALSA will be available)_

_(if a PulseAudio server is not found at runtime, the plugin will dynamically fall back to ALSA)_

_(a specifc backend can be forced by using this syntax before running afb-daemon : **$ export AFB_AUDIO_OUTPUT=Alsa**)_

<br />


### Media

A sample Media Server plugin with 1 backend:

 * Rygel

This plugin is able to detect a local Rygel UPnP media server, list audio files, select an audio file for playback, play/pause/seek in this file, upload an audio file to the server.

**Verbs**:

* _ping:_ returns a success response
* _init:_ initializes backend, looking for an active local UPnP server
* _list:_ returns list of audio files, as a JSON structure
* _select:_ select an audio files, by index number (001-...)
* _play:_ plays the currently selected audio file
* _stop:_ stops the currently selected audio file
* _pause:_ pauses the currently selected audio file
* _seek:_ seeks in the currently selected audio file, in seconds
* _upload:_ uploads an audio file, with a POST request

_(if GUPnP/GSSDP development libraries are not fund at build time, this plugin will not be built)_
